# Analysis_Tools

This repo contains tools intended to be used following preprocessing by the 4i pipeline. Use the adata_conversion notebook to produce an anndata object from the output of the 4i pipelines cell_data folder. All other tools will use this prebuilt adata object, removing the need to reprocess the data each time. 

This toolkit is currently incomplete, but is growing as I continue to compartmentalize my own analysis code.
